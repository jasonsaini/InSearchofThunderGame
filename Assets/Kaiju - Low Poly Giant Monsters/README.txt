Thank you for your purchase of Kaiju: Low Poly Giant Monsters!

Several of the kaiju in this pack contain simple scripts to create simple procedural animations by moving legs using IK, 
wings using sine functions, etc. All of the kaiju with such scripts have a child object named "NavTarget". In order to
move the kaiju using the procedural animations, make sure to move the nav target object rather than the kaiju itself.

Is a legged kaiju's default moving speed too slow for your taste? Find the follow script on the kaiju and change the speed
value. Make sure to adjust the speed value in the leg scripts accordingly!

If you do not wish to use procedural animations, this package also has a separate folder (Kaiju - Low Poly Monster / 
Contents / Prefabs / Static) with all of the scripts removed!

If you have any more questions or have any ideas on how this package could be expanded, 
email us at distantlands.productions@gmail.com!
